        <p>We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore 
            and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apps spot apps, sites and devices, such as Search,Apps spot Home</li><br/>
                <li>Platforms such as the Chrome browser and Android operating system</li><br/>
                <li>Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics and embedded Maps</li><br/>
            </ul>
        <p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you 
            can sign up for a Apps spot Account if you want to create and manage content such as 
            emails and photos, or to see more relevant search results. And you can use many Apps spot 
            services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all; for example,
            searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse
            the web in a private mode, like
            <a href ="">Chrome Incognito</a> mode, which helps keep your browsing 
            private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust 
            your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.

Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.</p>
        <p>When you’re signed in and interact with some App spot services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads, depending on your Shared Endorsements setting.</p>
